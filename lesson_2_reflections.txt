What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git begins to follow and track changes made to files and folders inside that directory in a repo.
This is done to begin your version control of a project.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is conceptual - not an actual physical location or storage.
It helps package different files up into logical units for a commit, instead of committing everything or one-by-one.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By performing a diff on the staging area, you can see exactly what gets committed on the commit command.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches help keep variants or new features out of the latest code until ready.  They can also help "milestone" a build for LTS or other such scenarios.
