What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git begins to follow and track changes made to files and folders inside that directory in a repo.
This is done to begin your version control of a project.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is conceptual - not an actual physical location or storage.
It helps package different files up into logical units for a commit, instead of committing everything or one-by-one.
