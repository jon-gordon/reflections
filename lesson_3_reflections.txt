When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Collaboration or sharing of the project with a wider audience.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Lots of merging, adding of new features, keeping up to date, conflicts, etc.  Nightmare.
Manual control allows choice to be made in a similar vein to choosing commits manually.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are GitHub (remote?) held copies of other repos - needed when you don't have permission on original repo / want to create a variant (larger than branching)
Clones are direct copies of repos.  Can be local or remote.
Branches are different development paths within a repo.  Used to experiment, temporary changes, etc.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You don't need to be online in any way to perform work against it.  It's also easier to see diffs.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Manual sending of source durectories, using a diff tool to merge and send back.  Very manual and laborious.
Or, I'd use another SCM tool like SVN or PTC.
