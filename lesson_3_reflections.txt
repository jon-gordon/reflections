When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Collaboration or sharing of the project with a wider audience.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Lots oof merging, adding of new features, keeping up to date, conflicts, etc.  Nightmare.
Manual control allows choice to be made in a similar vein to choosing commits manually.
